You will receive up to 8 images in a single request.  
For each image, do the following:

1. Detect a single barcode, if present, and the only thing in the image.
2. Otherwise,  if it is a single ingredient or a collection of ingredients, detect the ingredient(s) in the image, or on a receipt.

Barcodes should be interpreted as a string, ingredients can be a collection of actual ingredients in an image, or the ingredients on a receipt. If the receipt items are obscure or cryptic, try to guess what they might be.
